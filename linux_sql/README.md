# Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent
# Introduction
This project will allow Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team to track hardware information and recourse usage of each node in real-time, which are running on CentOS 7. This is done by gathering server usage data such as: available memory, disk space, cpu idle, and cpu kernel, ..etc. These information are collected and saved in a PostgreSQL database automatically evey minute in the background. On the other hand, the hardware specifications data like: system hostname, number of CPU, CPU architecture, ... etc. They are assumed to be static, which means that they will be collected once only. <br/>
