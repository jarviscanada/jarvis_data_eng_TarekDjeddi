The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of LGS contacted Jarvis consulting software and data engineering services in order to deliver a Proof Of Concept (POC) by visulaizing and analying their data to understand their customers behaviour, which will help LGS marketing team to make decisions in the hope of improving the performance with LGS and gain more profit since their revune did not grow in the past last years. LGS data is stored in a PostgreSQL database which is provisioned using a docker container, and then it is connected to the Jupyter Notebook to answer all the business questions.
